* Dionaea Flower Genes

** Idea

Are Flower genes re-used in the trap to attract prey insects

** Material an Methods

*** Data

**** _Dionaea muscipula_

RNAseq data for flower, rim, and maybe trap in house

**** *Arabidopsis thaliana*

**** Species Set

We need a evenly covered set of flowering plants (Angiosperms ;-) ). For phylogeny see https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/18972 . Download genomic information from [Ensembl Plants](https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html) , where possible.
- _Dionaea muscipula_
- _Aldrovanda vesiculosa_
- _Drosera spatulata_
- _Cephalotus?_
- _Amborella_

*** Methods

1. In _D. muscipula_ identify genes which are significantly higher expressed (i) in flowers compared to petiole (aka leaf) and (ii) in rim compared to petiole
2. In _A. thaliana_ identify genes which are significantly higher expressed in the flower than in the leaf
3. Identify orthologous genes between _D. muscipula_ and _A. thaliana_ using a species set covering the Angiosperms. Do we want more carnivorous plants in the tree?
4. Combine the three data sets to identify orthologous genes 'enriched' in the flower of _D. muscipula_ and of _A. thaliana_ . Which of these genes are also enriched in the rim of the trap of _D. muscipula_ ?

**** Identification of DEGs

**** Orthology
